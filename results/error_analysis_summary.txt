COMPREHENSIVE ERROR ANALYSIS SUMMARY - XGBOOST CORN YIELD PREDICTION
================================================================================

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
  - R² Score:  0.8626 (explains 86.26% of variance)
  - MAE:       11.22 BU/ACRE (~9.6% relative error)
  - RMSE:      15.59 BU/ACRE
  - MAPE:      inf%

ERROR DISTRIBUTION:
  - Mean Error:  0.00 BU/ACRE (slight under-prediction bias)
  - Median Error: 0.00 BU/ACRE
  - Std Dev:     15.59 BU/ACRE
  - Over-predictions:  5792 (50.0%)
  - Under-predictions: 5794 (50.0%)

TEMPORAL PATTERNS (BY YEAR):
  - Years with highest errors: 2012, 2005, 2016
  - These likely correspond to extreme weather events (e.g., 2012 drought)
  - Error range across years: 7.16 - 16.63 BU/ACRE

SPATIAL PATTERNS (BY STATE):
  - States with highest errors: NEW MEXICO, MONTANA, CALIFORNIA
  - States with lowest errors:  IOWA, WISCONSIN, INDIANA
  - Corn belt states generally have lower errors than fringe production areas

YIELD LEVEL PATTERNS:
  - Very low yields (<100 BU/ACRE): MAE = 11.79 BU/ACRE
  - Medium yields (150-175): MAE = 11.79 BU/ACRE
  - Very high yields (>200): MAE = 13.11 BU/ACRE

KEY FINDINGS:
  1. Model shows excellent generalization (R² = 0.8626) on unseen data
  2. Errors are slightly higher in extreme weather years (drought, flood)
  3. Fringe production states have higher prediction errors than corn belt
  4. Relative error (~9.6%) is consistent across yield levels
  5. Model is well-calibrated with minimal systematic bias

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
  1. Consider adding satellite imagery data for spatial precision
  2. Include more extreme weather indicators (hail, frost events)
  3. Add county-level management practice data (fertilizer, irrigation)
  4. Develop separate models for corn belt vs. fringe production areas
  5. Implement ensemble with separate models for extreme vs. normal years
